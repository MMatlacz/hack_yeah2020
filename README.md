# Hackathon Project Template

## TODO

+ resolve all `TODO`s from the code
+ make some nice project generator for it, using something like:
    + [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
    + [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)
+ create specialized `Response` implementation
+ extend flask's `Blueprint` to support `socket.io`
